# Tetris but Harder

Author: Daniel Huang

#### Project Description
For this project, I wish to create a model of the classic Tetris game with a twist: the game pieces will be controlled by
rotating precisely (rather than 90 degrees) and they will follow the laws of motion. Because of the significant gap in 
difficulty, scoring will be based on time spent alive without topping out, not based on the lines cleared.

#### Background Knowledge
The background knowledge I have for this project includes physics (mechanics) from class. Some base concepts that I will
be using from physics will be the application of center of mass and gravity/acceleration, rotational inertia and maybe 
torque as well. A reason that I want to make this project is because Tetris is a game that I have been playing for many 
years and I would like to make an interesting addition to a make the game much harder and less dull.

#### To-Do Timeline
* First week
    * Create game pieces and have base layout of the game/window.
    * Incorporate the physics to each piece and how they will fall and interact
    * Begin coding the game logic for scoring, piece distribution, and clearing lines
* Second Week 
    * Finish game logic
    * Work on making the user interface / visual features (e.g. scoreboard, next piece, hold)
*  Third Week
    * Finish making user interface. 
    * Additional features: audio, changing speed, different types of input
    * Final changes and alterations


##### Extra Stretch Goals
* Add leaderboard/running tally
* Tracking miscellaneous statistics
* Allow user to modify input mappings
